        <title>Day One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is Day One. Me and Zoe are launching this blog as a place for us to work together and think things through. Not always will out takes be good, in fact many of them are likely to be bad: that’s the point. We want to work out how and what we think about today’s issues using a variety of tools and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am from Medicine Hat, Alberta. I grew up in a fairly conservative household, although am not a self-prescribed conservative. Zoe, from Vancouver, British Columbia, had a very different upbringing, growing up in what she often calls a “hippy” family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our backgrounds are in Science (Landon) and Political Science/Sustainability (Zoe) and we hope these backgrounds will serve us well in this undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to providing unique thoughts and takes on today’s issues, both in the media and more obscure. Check back! We will be publishing soon!&lt;/p&gt;
