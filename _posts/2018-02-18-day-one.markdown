Today is Day One. Me and Zoe are launching this blog as a place for us to work together and think things through. Not always will out takes be good, in fact many of them are likely to be bad: that's the point. We want to work out how and what we think about today's issues using a variety of tools and backgrounds.

I am from Medicine Hat, Alberta. I grew up in a fairly conservative household, although am not a self-prescribed conservative. Zoe, from Vancouver, British Columbia, had a very different upbringing, growing up in what she often calls a "hippy" family.

Our backgrounds are in Science (Landon) and Political Science/Sustainability (Zoe) and we hope these backgrounds will serve us well in this undertaking.

We look forward to providing unique thoughts and takes on today's issues, both in the media and more obscure. Check back! We will be publishing soon!
